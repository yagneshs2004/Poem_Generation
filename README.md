# Poem_Generation
A NLP powered model to complete the poem based on its trainning on William Shakespeare's Sonnets, trying to replicate his writting skills. I used all the sonnets to train the model, which had a good end result.
With more developments towards the NLP sector, in future machines can even write us their own innovative stories.
